    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Falashade Greene born in and raised in Maryland. At 19 I moved to New York City to persue an education in fashion design and merchandising. I worked in the garment industry for about 7 years, then moved into retail as a manager. After 10 years in NY, I relocated back to my home state of maryland while still working in retail.<br>
      
    <br>After a few years I began working with a staffing agency as a employee advocate. I took some time to re-evaluate my career goals and become drawn to technology. I began self teaching and taking free courses on HTML and CSS. I fell in love with coding and wanted to learn more. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer in the tech space and looking forward making progress within my learning journey.
